# Modern Agriculture Technology Innovation Center (MATIC)

## Overview

The project focuses on revolutionizing mango logistics through advanced embedded systems and mobile application development. This system encompasses the entire mango logistics processâ€” from inward logistics and grading to ripening and outward processes. By integrating load sensors with a Flutter-based mobile app and Firebase, the project enables real-time weight tracking and process management, streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency in mango logistics.

## Features

    Inward Logistics: Track the arrival and initial handling of mangoes.
    Grading System: Automated grading based on quality parameters.
    Ripening Management: Monitor and control the ripening process to ensure optimal fruit quality.
    Outward Logistics: Manage and track the distribution of ripe mangoes.
    Real-Time Weight Tracking: Integrated load sensors provide real-time weight data to the mobile app.
    Flutter Mobile App: A user-friendly app for managing and monitoring the logistics processes.
    Firebase Integration: Real-time data synchronization and management.

## Technologies Used

    Mobile Application: Flutter
    Backend: Firebase
    Embedded Systems: Load sensors, microcontrollers (specify if known)
    Real-Time Data Management: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore
    Other Tools: (Specify any additional tools or libraries used)
